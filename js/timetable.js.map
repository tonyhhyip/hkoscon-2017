One handy way to obtain\n * it is to use ES6 `import * as reducers` syntax. The reducers may never return\n * undefined for any action. Instead, they should return their initial state\n * if the state passed to them was undefined, and the current state for any\n * unrecognized action.\n *\n * @returns {Function} A reducer function that invokes every reducer inside the\n * passed object, and builds a state object with the same shape.\n */\nexport default function combineReducers(reducers) {\n  var reducerKeys = Object.keys(reducers);\n  var finalReducers = {};\n  for (var i = 0; i < reducerKeys.length; i++) {\n    var key = reducerKeys[i];\n\n    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n      if (typeof reducers[key] === 'undefined') {\n        warning('No reducer provided for key \"' + key + '\"');\n      }\n    }\n\n    if (typeof reducers[key] === 'function') {\n      finalReducers[key] = reducers[key];\n    }\n  }\n  var finalReducerKeys = Object.keys(finalReducers);\n\n  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n    var unexpectedKeyCache = {};\n  }\n\n  var sanityError;\n  try {\n    assertReducerSanity(finalReducers);\n  } catch (e) {\n    sanityError = e;\n  }\n\n  return function combination() {\n    var state = arguments.length <= 0 || arguments[0] === undefined ? {} : arguments[0];\n    var action = arguments[1];\n\n    if (sanityError) {\n      throw sanityError;\n    }\n\n    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n      var warningMessage = getUnexpectedStateShapeWarningMessage(state, finalReducers, action, unexpectedKeyCache);\n      if (warningMessage) {\n        warning(warningMessage);\n      }\n    }\n\n    var hasChanged = false;\n    var nextState = {};\n    for (var i = 0; i < finalReducerKeys.length; i++) {\n      var key = finalReducerKeys[i];\n      var reducer = finalReducers[key];\n      var previousStateForKey = state[key];\n      var nextStateForKey = reducer(previousStateForKey, action);\n      if (typeof nextStateForKey === 'undefined') {\n        var errorMessage = getUndefinedStateErrorMessage(key, action);\n        throw new Error(errorMessage);\n      }\n      nextState[key] = nextStateForKey;\n      hasChanged = hasChanged || nextStateForKey !== previousStateForKey;\n    }\n    return hasChanged ? nextState : state;\n  };\n}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./~/redux/es/combineReducers.js","module.exports = require('./lib/index');\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./~/symbol-observable/index.js","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n\nvar _ponyfill = require('./ponyfill');\n\nvar _ponyfill2 = _interopRequireDefault(_ponyfill);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { 'default': obj }; }\n\nvar root; /* global window */\n\n\nif (typeof self !== 'undefined') {\n  root = self;\n} else if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n  root = window;\n} else if (typeof global !== 'undefined') {\n  root = global;\n} else if (typeof module !== 'undefined') {\n  root = module;\n} else {\n  root = Function('return this')();\n}\n\nvar result = (0, _ponyfill2['default'])(root);\nexports['default'] = result;\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./~/symbol-observable/lib/index.js","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\tvalue: true\n});\nexports['default'] = symbolObservablePonyfill;\nfunction symbolObservablePonyfill(root) {\n\tvar result;\n\tvar _Symbol = root.Symbol;\n\n\tif (typeof _Symbol === 'function') {\n\t\tif (_Symbol.observable) {\n\t\t\tresult = _Symbol.observable;\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tresult = _Symbol('observable');\n\t\t\t_Symbol.observable = result;\n\t\t}\n\t} else {\n\t\tresult = '@@observable';\n\t}\n\n\treturn result;\n};\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./~/symbol-observable/lib/ponyfill.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
